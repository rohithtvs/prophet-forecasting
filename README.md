# Time Series Forecasting with Facebook Prophet

📊 **A simple real-world project demonstrating Time Series Forecasting using Facebook Prophet in Python. This project covers key concepts such as Predictive Maintenance, Auto Thresholding, Capacity Planning, and Anomaly Detection with real-world data.**

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **Facebook Prophet** for **Time Series Forecasting** with real-world applications such as:  

-	**Predictive Maintenance** – Forecasting equipment failures before they happen.  
-	 **Auto Thresholding** – Setting dynamic thresholds for automated monitoring.
-	 **Capacity Planning** – Forecasting future demand and resource allocation.  
-	 **Anomaly Detection** – Identifying unusual patterns in time-series data.
